Matthew Que

## Introduction:

This is a guide on how to use the run_analysis.R script to retrieve and clean
up the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset. The goal of this
guide is to provide detailed information on the variables, data, and transformations
performed to clean up the data. The script is used to clean up and merge the 
provided datasets, namely Training and Test datasets into one dataset, and 
summarize this dataset to provide a meaningful dataset containing the average
of each measurements by each subject and their activities.

## Data set information:

The provided datasets contains the list of experiments conducted for Human 
Activity Recognition using Smartphones. The dataset is retrieved from UCI
Machine Learning Repository.There are two datasets provided and used in the 
script:
- Training Data
- Test Data
