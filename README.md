# Introduction:

## This is a guide on how to use the run_analysis.R script to retrieve and clean
## up the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset. The goal of this
## guide is to provide detailed information on the variables, data, and transformations
## performed to clean up the data. The script is used to clean up and merge the 
## provided datasets, namely Training and Test datasets into one dataset, and 
## summarize this dataset to provide a meaningful dataset containing the average
## of each measurements by each subject and their activities.

# Data set information:

## The provided datasets contains the list of experiments conducted for Human 
## Activity Recognition using Smartphones. The dataset is retrieved from UCI
## Machine Learning Repository.There are two datasets provided and used in the 
## script:
## - Training Data
## - Test Data

# Variables:

## Below are the list of variables that are generated by the script:
## - dataset
## - summarydataset

## Variable - dataset

### This dataset contains the merged training and test datasets which only contains
### measurements using mean and standard deviations.

## Variable - summarydataset

### This dataset contains the summarized dataset from the dataset variable. This
### dataset is provides information on the average of each variables grouped by 
### each subject and their activities

# Data transformation:

## To clean up the data, there are multiple steps that are done on the dataset.
## These process were done on both the Training and Test datasets:
## 1. Converting the columns of the dataset to  its proper data type
## 2. Use desecriptive activity names
## 3. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each
##    masuresments
## 4. Use desecriptive variable names
## 5. Merge the tidy datasets
## 6. Summarize the datasets
